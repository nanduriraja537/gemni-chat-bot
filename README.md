#### Option 1: Install directly

```bash
pip install google-generativeai langchain-google-genai streamlit
 
```

#### Option 2: Install using `requirements.txt`

If you have a `requirements.txt` file, you can install all dependencies listed in the file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Application

### Step 2: Start the Application

To run the application, execute the following command:

```bash
python gemini-bot.py
```

### Step 3: Launch the Streamlit App

After starting the application, run the Streamlit app with:

```bash
streamlit run gemini-bot.py

streamlit run gemni-read-dataset.py

1. upload the csv document 
   C:\Users\Rajarama_Nanduri\python_workspace\gemini-working-scenario\dataset.csv
